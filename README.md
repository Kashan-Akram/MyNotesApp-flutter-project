My First Flutter project.

This project is my starting point into the world of Flutter App Development.

An elegant notes taking app written in Flutter that uses google cloud firestore for storage.

The App is pretty much complete, the only thing that I think is missing in this project is a splash screen and I will implement that once I learn Flutter Animations and basic designing using Figma.
